# ðŸ“Š Comparing ANN and CNN for Image Classification using CIFAR-10

## Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a standard benchmark for image classification tasks. By implementing both models, we explore their effectiveness in handling image data, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and evaluate their performance based on various metrics.

## Dataset
The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class:

- **Number of Training Images**: 50,000
- **Number of Test Images**: 10,000
- **Classes**: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

The CIFAR-10 dataset is widely used for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms due to its balanced class distribution and moderate size.

## Objectives
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluate and compare the performance of ANN and CNN models on the CIFAR-10 dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Architectural Analysis**: Analyze the differences between ANN and CNN architectures and how they affect the models' ability to classify images.
- **Model Implementation**: Implement both ANN and CNN models using TensorFlow/Keras, and train them on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Performance Insights**: Visualize and interpret the results to understand which model performs better and why, considering factors like training time, computational cost, and generalization capabilities.
